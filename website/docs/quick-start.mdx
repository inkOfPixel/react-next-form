React Next Form is a lightweight React library for form state management. It simplifies the development of form for CRUD interfaces
and supports validation (with yup), partial reset that enables realtime updates.

## Installation

React Next Form relies on [immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/docs/introduction) for immutable updates and [yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) for schema validation.

```bash
# npm
npm i --save react-next-form immer yup

# or yarn
yarn add -E react-next-form immer yup
```

## The gist

```jsx
import { useForm } from "react-next-form";
import * as yup from "yup";

function MyPlayground(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <ButtonExample onClick={() => alert("hey!")}>Click me</ButtonExample>
    </div>
  );
}
```
